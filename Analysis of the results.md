# Analysis of the Results


## Overview of Project

This analysis aims to help the client Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
Based on the Kickstarter dataset, this document particularly analyzes the *"Theater Outcomes by Launch Date"* and  the *" Outcomes of the Goals"* under the subcategory "plays". To better explore the analysis,  we visualized two line charts to picture the data tendency, ![Theater Outcomes by Launch Date] (https://github.com/ruimin1231/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png.png) and ![Outcomes of the Goals] (https://github.com/ruimin1231/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png).


## Analysis and Challenges

### 1 Formual Check and Review

Sometimes when I applied a formula such as "COUNTIF", the result was wrong when I ignored some necessary criteria. In this case, double-checking the result and comparing it with the original data in the Kickstarter dataset is important. Otherwise, the wrong result will cause a wrong chart.

### 2 File Crashes

With the more newly created sheets, the size of the file will become bigger. In this case, saving the updating edits frequently is necessary, otherwise, the document may suddenly crash.


## Results

### Conclusions of the *Theater Outcomes by Launch Date*

1. By reading the line chart of "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date", we can see that there was a spike of success in May. Jan, Mar, Sep, and Nov had the relatively same low numbers of failed outcomes. 

2. There were no theater outcomes in 2009.

### Conclusion of the *"Outcomes based on Goals"*

1. There was no "canceled" outcomes under the subcategory of "plays" and the goal that is less than $1,000 has the largest percentage of success.


### Limitations and recommendations of the analysis

#### Limitations

As for the Kickstarter dataset, there is no more info on backers' backgrounds. It will be better if we can build more connections between the country of a program and the backers who invested in it. As for the blurb, it's hard to read each blurb in a such huge data set. In this case, distilling some keywords from each blurb and categorizing them into a new column such as "Topics" will be helpful.

#### Recommendations

A table that can display the duration of each campaign will help the clients understand how the time will influence the outcomes of the pledges. A pivot table that could display the spotlight will also be helpful.
